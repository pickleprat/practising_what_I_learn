Lyrics:

When you get that funny feeling
Way down low
Just stop what you’re doing
And go go go!

What are you doing?  Where did you go?
What are you doing?  I want to know!
I went to the potty, and washed my hands too
I went to the potty like the big kids do!

How do I do that?  How do I go? 
How do I do that?  I want to know!
Just sit on the potty, sit and wait
Sit on the potty and it will be great!

I’m sitting on the potty, ready to go
But nothing is happening, and why, I don’t know
Try again later, it’s okay,
Try again later, later today

I’ve got the funny feeling, way down low
I’ve got the funny feeling, I think I have to go!
Just sit on the potty, sit and wait
Sit on the potty and it will be great!

I went to the potty!  Look and see!
I went to the potty, hooray for me!
Great job, J.J., now wash your hands!
Great job, J.J., now do the potty dance!

Great job, J.J., do the potty dance
I/we got you some big boy underpants
When you get that funny feeling way down low, 
Stop what you’re doing and go, go, go!

Let’s all count sheep
Count 1, 2, 3
Until we sleep
Let’s all count sheep

Could we keep playing
Miss Appleberry  
Could we keep playing
Please, please

You’ll play your best
If you have some rest
You’ll play your best  
If you have some rest

I’m scared of the dark
Miss Appleberry 
I’m scared of the dark
Please,  please

See our light shine
You’ll be just fine
See our light shine
You will be just fine

I’m all by myself
Miss Appleberry 
I’m all by myself
Please,  please

There’s no need to fear 
With your teddy here
There’s no need to fear 
With your teddy here
 
In dreams you can fly
Through a starry sky
When nap time is done 
We will have more fun

Let’s all count sheep
Count 1, 2, 3

Lyrics:

Today’s the day!  It’s the first day of school
So many new things to learn and do
I’m so excited, but nervous too
But it will be ok on my first day of school

Do you have your backpack?  Yes I do!
Do you have your shoes?  Yes I do!
Do you have your Lunch?  Yes I do!
Do you have your Teddy?  Yes I do!

Will you greet your teacher?  Yes I will!
Will you make new friends?  Yes I will!
Will you play some games?  Yes I will!
Will you learn new things?  Yes I will!

Are you excited?  Yes I am!
Are you nervous?  Yes I am!
Are you smiling?  Yes I am!
Are you ready?  Yes I am!

Did you find your cubby?  Yes I did!
Did you hang your backpack?  Yes I did!
Did you give a hug?  Yes I did! (lovingly)
Did you say goodbye?

I’ve got tortillas with some rice and beans
Salsa and some leafy greens

I’ve got pasta with tomato sauce
Bread and salad that’s been tossed
Pasta with tomato sauce
Bread and salad tossed

I’ve got chicken dumplings with some rice
Veggies that taste very nice
Chicken dumplings with some rice
Veggies very nice

I’ve got a sandwich made with ham and cheese
Broccoli and apples, please
Sandwich made with ham and cheese
Broccoli, apples, please

I’ve got potatoes and roast beef, you see
Peanut butter celery
Potatoes and roast beef, you see

Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la la la la
‘Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la la la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la la la la la la la
Troll the ancient yuletide carol
Fa la la la la la la la la

See the blazing Yule before us
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
While I tell of Yule-tide treasure
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Fast away the old year passes
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Hail the new year, lads and lasses
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Sing we joyous, all together
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Heedless of the wind and weather
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

All the toys and games we played
And one big giant mess we made

Over here and over there
Up and down and everywhere
There’s cars and trucks and boats and trains
And buses and a model plane

Over here and over there
Up and down and everywhere
There’s paper, brushes, paints and glue
And lots of pictures that we drew

Over here and over there
Up and down and everywhere
There’s shoes and socks and balls and bats
And shirts and capes and silly hats

Lyrics:

My baby tooth is loose today
Am I going to be okay?

Don’t you worry, it’s okay

If you leave your tooth alone
Your tooth will fall out on its own
Your baby teeth will fall away
But new teeth will grow -- someday
   
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready?   
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready? 
Wiggle, Wiggle, no not yet    
My baby tooth’s not ready yet

Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready?
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready? 
Wiggle Wiggle, getting close!  
My baby tooth is getting close!

If I leave my tooth alone
My tooth will fall out on its own
My baby teeth will fall away
But new teeth will grow -- someday

Look my tooth is loose, see?

Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready?
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready? 
Wiggle Wiggle almost there!  
My baby tooth is almost there!

Wiggle Wiggle Is it ready?
Wiggle Wiggle! Is it ready? 
Wiggle Wiggle!⸺
It came out! 

My baby tooth came out today (He holds up his tooth)
But I’m not sad, Hip-Hip-Hooray!
My brand new tooth will grow and grow
I won’t be TOOTHLESS anymore!

Lyrics: 

Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow

And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went 
The lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rules

It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school

So the teacher turned him out
Turned him out, turned him out
So the teacher turned him out
But still he lingered near

And he waited patiently
Patiently, patiently
And he waited patiently
‘Till Mary did appear

Why does the lamb love Mary so?
Love Mary so, love Mary so?
Why does the lamb love Mary so?
The eager children cried

Why, Mary loves the lamb you know
Lamb you know, lamb you know
Why, Mary loves the lamb you know
The teacher did reply

Here we go Looby Loo
Here we go Looby Light
Here we go Looby Loo
All on a Saturday night!

You put your right hand in
You put your right hand out
You give your hand a shake, shake, shake
And turn yourself about

You put your left hand in
You put your left hand out
You give your hand a shake, shake, shake
And turn yourself about

You put your right foot in
You put your right foot out
You give your foot a shake, shake, shake
And turn yourself about

You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out
You give your foot a shake, shake, shake
And turn yourself about

You put your whole self in
You put your whole self out
You give yourself a shake, shake, shake
And turn yourself about

The Dinosaurs lived long ago
They hatched from little eggs
They start so small but grow, and grow!
What dinos do you know?

“Tyrannosaurus!” 
“Pteranodon!”
“Parasaur!”
“Ultrasaurus!”
“Stegosaurus!”
“Triceratops!”

The Tyrannosaurus he’s the best
My favorite Dinosaur
With little arms and big sharp teeth 
To chomp and chomp and ROAR!  

The Pteranodon she’s the best
My favorite Dinosaur
She’s got a beak and big long wings
To flap and flap and ROAR! 

The Parasaur she’s the best
My favorite Dinosaur
With a classy crest and ducky bill
To munch and munch and ROAR!

The Ultrasaurus he’s the best
My favorite Dinosaur
With a great long neck and giant feet
To stomp and stomp and ROAR!

The Stegosaurus he’s the best
My favorite Dinosaur
With plates on his back and spiky tail
To smash and smash and ROAR!

The Triceratops she’s the best
My favorite Dinosaur
With a fancy frill and three long horns
To charge and charge and ROAR!

“Tyrannosaurus!” 
“Pteranodon!”
“Parasaur!”
“Ultrasaurus!”
“Stegosaurus!”
“Triceratops!”

Lyrics:
Verse 1
Deck the halls with boughs of holly.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
'Tis the season to be jolly.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Don we now our gay apparel.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la!
Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!

Verse 2
See the blazing Yule before us.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Strike the harp and join the chorus.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Follow me in merry measure.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la!
While I tell of Yule-tide treasure.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!

Verse 3
Fast away the old year passes.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Hail the new year, lads and lasses.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Sing we joyous, all together.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la!
Heedless of the wind and weather.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!

Verse 4
Deck the halls with boughs of holly.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
'Tis the season to be jolly.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la!
Don we now our gay apparel.
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la!
Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol.

Lyrics:
All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
The piano is so grand,
You play it with your hands
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
The guitar, it has six strings,
You can play it while you sing
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
Play the drums and keep the beat
With your hands and with your feet
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
Violin is high, not low
And you play it with a bow
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
The tuba sounds so low,
So take a breath and blow
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
When you play upon a flute
It makes a happy toot,
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
Play the xylophone with sticks
The notes are short and quick
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
The harmonica is small
The smallest one of all
It goes:

All the animals are playing in the band
They’re having so much fun!
They all play with the beat
As they’re marching down the street
They go:

Where is our class pet?
Oh, where could she be?
We’re looking and looking  
Searching for clues
Where is...
Jelly Bean?

We’ve lost the class pet
We’ve lost Jelly Bean
She’s the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings  

We’ve lost the class pet
We’ve lost Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
Oh where could she be?

We’ve lost the class pet
We’ve lost Jelly Bean
She’s the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings

We’ve lost the class pet
We’ve lost Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
Oh where could she be?

We’ve lost the class pet
We’ve lost Jelly Bean
She’s the softest thing
She squeaks when she sings

Jelly Bean!

This is our class pet
We found Jelly Bean
She has such tiny feet
She’s cuddly and sweet!

Look at the many things

She cares for me and you
Look at the many things

And hard stuff too
I want to be like you

Look at the many things

She cares for me and you
Look at the many things

I want to be

Lyrics: 
It’s a special day, Hurray!
My school has planned a dino day
I want to roar, I want to shout
But Dino Day’s not happening now

Hey, Buddy. Don’t worry, you can make your own special day

My special day has gone away!
Now that it’s not dino day
Don’t want to roar just want to pout
Cause Dino Day’s not happening now

Spoken (Cody’s Dad): What’s Wrong Buddy?
Spoken (Cody): I just wanted today to be special.

You can make your own happiness 
Give it a try 
Take a look inside...your heart
You can make your own happiness 
The day will be special 
Just bring what’s inside...Outside!

“Yeah! I can make my own special dino day!”

It’s a special day, hurray!
I’m putting on a dino day
Hear me roar - hear me shout
‘Cause dino day is staaaartingggg NOW! 
 
RAWRRRRR!

Lyrics:

In the summer the ants were a-working
Bringing food to their hill every day
While the grasshopper sang in the sunshine
On his fiddle, his song he did play.

“Fi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
I will sing all the while ‘neath the sunshine!
‘Neath the moon, I will dance, I will play!”

In the autumn the ants were still working
But the grasshopper still did not care
The ants asked “Why don’t you store food for winter?”
“When it’s cold, you’ll have no food to spare.”

“Fi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
‘Bove us all, there will always be sunshine
And there always will be time to play!”

Time went by, and along came the winter
And the wind gave a cold icy chill
Snow fell down, and there was no more sunshine
So the grasshopper went up the hill.

“Fi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day
I am cold, I am wet, I am hungry
And I’m sorry I played the days away.”

In the valley he went to the anthill
He was cold, and embarrassed, and sad
But the ants told him that he was welcome
Then he thanked them and felt really glad!

“Fi-de-di, de-dah-doo, dah-de da-do
Fi-de-do, de-da-dee, de-da-day!”
And the grasshopper said in future seasons
Work comes first, then he’ll have time to play!

I can't sleep I had a bad dream
I need mommy here with me
Daddy please! Stay by my side
I can't sleep, Although I tried
 
When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Hold your cuddle buddy tight
Cuddles help you sleep tonight

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Watch the night light glowing bright
Light will help you sleep tonight
 
Spoken (Cody): Mommy? Daddy?

When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lots of things can help you sleep
Look around, what can you see?
Mommy gives a hug so tight
Hugs will help you sleep tonight

When you wake from a bad dream
Look around, what can you see?
Cozy in your happy place
Snug in bed so warm and safe

Lyrics:
For winter show and tell I love stockings full of treats!
And a star on top of the tree 

For winter show and tell I love popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell I love yummy sugar cookies
Popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell I love lights red and green
Yummy sugar cookies
Popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell I love playing in the snow
Lights red and green
Yummy sugar cookies
Popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell I love to dance ballet
Playing in the snow
Lights red and green
Yummy sugar cookies
Popcorn and a movie
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

For winter show and tell…
Pause in the music
For winter show and tell I love family time (slow! With a little pregnant pause at the end)
Tempo picks back up
Dancing Ballet
Playing in the snow
Lights red and green
Popcorn and a movie
Cookies so yummy
Stockings full of treats
And a star on top of the tree!

Lyrics:

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She’ll make sure you’re healthy
In every way

She’ll check your weight, she’ll check your height
She’ll check to see that you’re growing right

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She’ll make sure you’re healthy
In every way

She’ll check your lungs, she’ll check your heart
She’ll make sure they’re working, every part

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She’ll make sure you’re healthy
In every way

She’ll check your eyes, she’ll check your ears
She’ll check how well you see and hear

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She’ll make sure you’re healthy
In every way

She’ll check your mouth, she’ll check your throat
She’ll look at her checklist and make some notes

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She’ll make sure you’re healthy
In every way

She’ll check your reflex, she’ll check your bones
To see that they’re healthy, and how much you’ve grown

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She’ll make sure you’re healthy
In every way

Now she might say that you need a shot
But don’t be scared, it won’t hurt a lot

When you go see the doctor
For your checkup today
She’ll make sure you’re healthy
In every way

Let’s make our own construction site
We’ve got the tools to do it right
We’ll push and mix, smash and scoop
Like real construction vehicles do

The big steam roller pounds the ground
Pounds it flat while rolling round
Rolling, Rolling! It’s so much fun
To get construction done
 
The concrete mixer blends and spins
All we need to make cement
Blending, Spinning, it’s so much fun
To get construction done

The rumbly dump truck drops and loads
What we need, down the road
Dropping, Loading, it’s so much fun
To get construction done

The great tall crane lowers and lifts 
Heavy things, smooth and swift
Lowering, Lifting, it’s so much fun
To get construction done

Let’s make our own construction site
We’ve got the tools to do it right
We’ll push and mix, smash and scoop 
Like real construction vehicles do

The excavator scoops and drops
Lots of dirt, cement, and rocks
Scooping, Dropping, it’s so much fun
To get construction done

The big bulldozer pushes ‘round
Dirt and rubble on the ground
Pushing, Pushing, it’s so much fun
To get construction done

Let’s make our own construction site
We’ve got the tools to do it right
We’ll push and mix, smash and scoop 
Like real construction vehicles do

It’s better to work together
Because it’s double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun
Yes! Share when you only have one!

“Ok boys, lets go inside”

Today’s our day to play
Having lots of fun
Playing with my dinosaur
Oh no we just have one!

When we work together everyone has more fun! 

It’s better to work together
Because it’s double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun
Yes! Share when you only have one!

Today’s our day to play
Though it’s almost done
I want the color blue
Oh no we just have one!

When we work together 
Everyone has more fun!

It’s better to work together
Because it’s double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun
Yes! Share when you only have one!

Today’s our day to play 
Out here in the sun  
Riding on the tricycle...
When we work together 
Everyone has more fun! 

“5, 4, 3, 2, 1 blastoff!”

It’s better to work together
Because it’s double the fun!
I have fun when you have fun
Yes! Share when you only have one!

Lyrics:
When it’s dark, no need to pout
You can take your flashlight out
Use your fingers, thumbs and all
So shadows play along the wall!
Place your hand up to the light
Your shadow dances in the night

Looky-look! a little snail
Crawling on the ground
Looky-look!  a bunny hops
Bouncing up and down

Looky-look! a silly goose
Eats berries one by one
Looky-look!  a hairy moose
The berries are all gone

With our thumbs and fingers too
We’ll make a shadow puppet zoo!

Looky-look! A happy cow
Listen to her moo
Looky-look! a big gray wolf
Howling at the moon

Looky-look! An elephant!
His trunk sways to and fro
Looky-look! A Spooky Spider!
A Spider!? Yikes! Let’s Go!

When it’s dark, no need to pout
You can take your flashlight out
Use your fingers, thumbs and all
So shadows play along the wall!
Place your hand up to the light
Your shadow dances in the night

Lyrics:
Hush little JJ, it’s time for bed
Go to sleep and rest your head

La la da dum

And if you can’t go to sleep
Papa’s gonna help you count some sheep

La la la la

You search for gifts all around
Mom says go sleep safe and sound

La la da dum

If you tiptoe down the stairs
Papa’s gonna carry you back up there

La la la la
Dad: Shhhhhhh 
JJ: Shhhhhhh 

Balloons wait for you to sleep
Papa says, not another peep

La la da dum

Your birthday is a special treat
Mama says, get some rest my sweet

La la la la

Though you still keep sneaking down
You’re still the sweetest little babe in town…
Tag: Still the sweetest little babe in town

La, la, la. La. la . la…
Hush, little JJ, it’s time for bed…

My big sister makes me laugh
She’s funnier than anyone
My big sister makes me laugh
She’s the best, she’s number one

My little sister plays with me
We play games out in the sun
My little sister plays with me
She’s the best, she’s number one

My big sister teaches me
Brand new things, it’s lots of fun
My big sister teaches me
She’s the best, she’s number one

My little sister helps me out
She helps make sure the job gets done
My little sister helps me out
She’s the best, she’s number one

I’m so glad there’s three of us
To laugh and play and run
When we do things together
It’s always much more fun

Lyrics:
Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He’s gonna love it.
Look, what’s up ahead?

Mud!

Can’t go over it
Can’t go under it
Can’t go through it
I gotta go around it!
Sloshy slosh, sloshy slosh.

Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He’s gonna love it.
Look, what’s up ahead?

Party Goodies!

Can’t go over it
Can’t go through it
Can’t go around it
I gotta go under it!
Swish swash, swish swash

Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He’s gonna love it.
Look, what’s up ahead?

Wind!

Can’t go over it
Can’t go under it
Can’t go around it
I gotta go through it!
Whoosh woo whoosh woo!

Going on a doggy hunt.
Going to catch my best friend.
He’s gonna love it.
Look, what’s up ahead?


Oh look! On the couch! 
What’s this?

Something funny.
With a long soft thing on its end
With two big ears
And a cold wet nose

Slightly longer interlude
It’s Bingo!.

Slurpy slurp, slurpy slurp.

C’mon Bingo! I have a surprise for you!

Run through the wind! 
Go under Dad! 
Slosh around the mud! 
And give your best dog a… a... 

Huh?...

Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
To our good dog!
*bark bark*

Lyrics:
 
Three little pigs went out one day
One built a house made out of hay
The other pigs thought it would fall, fall, fall
But the first didn’t care at all.
 
Three little pigs went out one day
The second used sticks to build away
The third pig thought it would fall, fall, fall
But the second didn’t care at all.
 
Three little pigs went out one day
For the third pig, bricks were the way
He knew the house wouldn’t fall, fall, fall
So the work didn’t bother him at all.
 
Then came a wolf who was big and bad
He was incredibly hungry and mad
The three little pigs saw the wolf that day
They slammed their doors and hid away
 
“Little pig, little pig, let me in!”
“Not by the hair on my chinny-chin chin!”
“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow, blow, blow!”
And boy, did the hay house go!
 
“Little pigs, little pigs, let me in!”
“Not by the hair on our chinny-chin chins!”
“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow, blow, blow!”
And boy, did the stick house go!
 
“Little pigs, little pigs, let me in!”
“Not by the hair on our chinny-chin chins !”
“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow, blow, blow!”
But the bricks surely did not go!
 
The wolf was at his wit’s end, you see
He climbed on the roof, down the brick chimney!
He came with his teeth all bared, bared, bared
So the three little pigs got scared!
 
The third little pig lit a log on fire
The smoke started rising, higher and higher
The wolf burned his hairy tail, OW! OW! OW!
And the wolf ran out of town!
 
The two little piggies of hay and sticks
Learned a lesson all about work and bricks
A hard-worked job won’t fall fall fall
To a huff, or a puff, at all!
 
The three little pigs went out that day
Now they were free to laugh and play
The Big Bad Wolf was gone gone gone
And the little pigs danced ‘til dawn!

Lyrics:
Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the little train cars
All in a row
See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug toot toot  
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the shiny train cars
All in a row
Waiting to get hitched up
And go on their adventure
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See my favorite engine
Ready to tow
All the other train cars
Will follow on behind it
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
Climb on aboard
And hear the whistle blow
Mr. Conductor
Please take my ticket
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go

Down by the station
Early in the morning
See the little train cars
All in a row
See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug puff puff
Off they go

See the station master
Turn the little handle
Chug chug toot toot 
Off they go
Chug chug toot toot
Off they go

It’s fun to ski side to side
On a white and snowy ride
Sliding down the bunny slope
Soaring, smiling wide

Place your boot in from the toe
Then you push your heel down low
Everyone let’s Go! Go! Go!
We’ll have fun out in the snow!

Do the duck walk in your skis
Form your skis into a “V”
Everyone let’s Go! Go! Go!
We’ll have fun out in the snow!

We love to ski! We love it all!  
As the dancing snowflakes fall 
It’s fun to ski side to side 
On a white and snowy ride

Make a pizza shape, okay
Help your skis to make an “A”
Everyone let’s Go! Go! Go!
We’ll have fun out in the snow!

Ride the magic carpet up
Then we’ll ski down from the top 
Everyone let’s Go! Go! Go! 
We’ll have fun out in the snow!

We love to ski! We love it all!  
As the dancing snowflakes fall 
It’s fun to ski side to side 
On a white and snowy ride

Let’s go down the bunny slope 
Not too fast and not too slow
Everyone let’s Go! Go! Go!
We’ll have fun out in the snow! 

We love to ski! We love it all!  
As the dancing snowflakes fall 
It’s fun to ski side to side 
On a white and snowy ride

Lyrics:

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
Whenever I am sick or hurt, she gives a great big kiss
She helps me to feel better and she does it just like this

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
She takes the time to play with me, all my favorite games
Even when she’s busy, she loves me just the same

My Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
My Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
Whenever I get hungry, she makes my favorite snacks
She makes them just the way I like, they’re great and that’s a fact

Your Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
Your Mommy is the best, and I love her just because
She laughs when I am silly, and likes to play along
We sing and dance together to all our favorite songs

Our Mommy is the best, the best there ever was
Our Mommy is the best, and we love her just because
She always takes good care of us, and she should be a queen
She’s the greatest mommy that we have ever seen

I love to be your mommy
Really?  It’s true!
You fill my life with lots of joy
You are my precious girl and boys
Really?  It’s true!
I love you!

Lyrics:
This box will get recycled soon
But while it’s still here with me
I’ll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be…

Sometimes I play with a toy
Sometimes I play with a friend
But when I play with this box,* 
I get to play pretend!

This box is a tough turtle shell
Resting on top of my back!
I hide my turtle head inside…
Then poke it out for a snack!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it’s still here with me
I’ll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be…

This box is a big bongo drum!
I bang it to play a song
I go TAP TAP, I go BOOM BOOM
I stomp and I sing along

This box rocks!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it’s still here with me
I’ll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be…

This box is a speedy race car!
ZOOMing and VROOMing around
Pickles is the race car driver
And I’m in charge of the sounds:

ZOOM! VROOM! BEEP! BEEP!

Pickles SFX: MEOW

SCREECH!
...There’s a ladybug crossing the street!

This box will get recycled soon
But while it’s still here with me
I’ll close my eyes and think about
All the fun things it could be…

These boxes will get recycled soon
But while they’re still here with me
We’ll close our eyes and think about
All the fun things they could be…
All the fun things these boxes could be!

Lyrics:
Dinos as lively as they can be
But one egg’s stuck in a tree
Get it down
Dinos as lively as they can be
They have ideas, you see
Dinos, they work as a dino team
But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don’t you see
If there’s another idea.

Dinos they jump all at once to see
If a quake will shake the tree
Boom! Boom! Boom!
Oopsie! The fruits fell right out the tree
Sticky as fruits can be!
Dinos, they work as a dino team
But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don’t you see
If there’s another idea.

Dinos they swing like in a trapeze
They think that this is a breeze!
Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Hey now! Don’t let go so quick-a-ly!
Look, now! You just missed the tree!
Dinos, they work as a dino team
But they have trouble it seems
Getting eggy out from the tree
Dinos, why don’t you see
If there’s another idea.

Dinos, they stack one on top of each
Stretching, just so they can reach
Poor Eggy!
Whoa there! You think you can reach the top?
Yippee! Be careful, don’t drop!
Dinos, they finally did succeed
Working as a dino team!
They got Eggy out from the tree
Dinos why don’t you see
What is inside the last egg!

Colors are so wonderful
Shining bright and beautiful
Red, Orange, Yellow and Blue
With Green and Purple too

Let’s make jiggly jello
With three primary colors
Primary colors?
Yes, Red, Blue and Yellow are primary colors
Because we use them to make all the other colors
Aha!

Let’s make jiggly jello
With three primary colors
Let’s make yummy jello
Of Red and Blue and Yellow

Red is bold and merry  
Blue is deep and cool
Yellow is warm and bright
Like the sunny light

Let’s set the timer and wait for our jello to cool

Ready to see your jello?

Colors are so wonderful
Shining bright and beautiful
Red, Orange, Yellow and Blue
With Green and Purple too

Let’s make jiggly jello
With three secondary colors
Secondary colors?
Yes, Orange, Green and Purple are secondary colors
Because they’re made from primary colors
Aha!

Let’s make jiggly jello
With three secondary colors
Let’s make yummy jello
Orange and Green and Purple

Wait! We don’t have those colors

Blue with yellow makes green jello
Yellow and red make orange instead
Red and blue make purple hues
Mixing colors is fun to do

Let’s set the timer and wait for our jello to cool
Ready to see your jello?

Colors are so wonderful
Shining bright and beautiful
Red, Orange, Yellow and Blue
With Green and Purple too

Lyrics:
Can you jump rope?
Let’s all jump rope!

Keep sticking to it!
Keep sticking to it!
You’re smart and tough
You’re strong enough
Keep sticking to it
And don’t ever give up!

one, two, three, four, FIVE!

I like carrots
I like plums
I’d like Bella
To froggy jump!

Kids: One!
Bella: Oh puppy tails!

It’s okay, try again!

Someone’s in my head
Saying “not a chance”
Someone’s in the mirror 
Telling me, I can’t
But…

One!

Try again later! 

I like carrots
I like plums
I’d like Cody
To froggy jump!

Kids: One, two, three, four!

I like carrots
I like plums
I’d like Cece
To froggy jump!

One, two, three, four, five!

Someone’s in my head
Saying “not a chance”

Someone’s in the mirror 
Telling you, you can’t
But…

Keep sticking to it!
Keep sticking to it!
You’re smart and tough
You’re strong enough
Keep sticking to it
And don’t ever give up!

I like carrots
I like plums
I’d like Nina
To froggy jump!

Kids: One, two, three, and four!

I like carrots
I like plums
I’d like Bella
To froggy jump!

One!

Try again?

Keep sticking to it! 

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!
Hop hop hurray!

Keep sticking to it!
Keep sticking to it!
You’re smart and tough
You’re strong enough
Keep sticking to it
And don’t ever give up!

My big brother plays with me
He taught me how to catch and throw
My big brother plays with me
He’s the best, he’s the best I know

My big brother makes me laugh
Even when I’m feeling low
My big brother makes me laugh
He’s the best, the best I know

My big brother fixes things
He makes them work and run and go
My big brother fixes things
He’s the best, the best I know

My big brother helps me out
With school and things that I don’t know
My big brother helps me out
He’s the best, the best I know

I’m so glad there’s three of us
To laugh and play and run
When we do things together
It’s always much more fun

We have 1 and 2, 3 and 4
5 and 6, still there’s more 
7 and 8, 9 and then
This little one makes 10

10 little eggs all sleeping 
10 little eggs in a row
Count them while they’re cozy
Count them all let’s go

10 little eggs are cracking
10 little eggs in a row
Count them while they’re hatching
Count them all let’s go

10 little chicks are chirping
10 little chicks in a row
Count them while they’re stretching
Count them all let’s go

10 little chicks are skipping
10 little chicks in a row
Count them while they’re playing
Count them all let’s go

Lyrics:
I’m on a train!
I’m listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And ‘neath the train
There are some tracks! 
The train goes Clicka Clacka!
I’m on a train!

I’m on a train!
I’m listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And on this train
There are some wheels!
The train goes Clicka Clacka! Chugga Chugga
I’m on a train!

I’m on a train!
I’m listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And on this train
There is a whistle!
The train goes Clicka Clacka! Chugga Chugga, Choo! Choo!
I’m on a train!

I’m on a train!
I’m listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And on this train
There’s a conductor!
The train goes Clicka Clacka! Chugga Chugga, Choo! Choo!  “All aboard!”
I’m on a train!

I’m on a train!
I’m listening
To all the sounds
The engine makes!
And on this train
We say goodbye!
The train goes Clicka Clacka! Chugga Chugga, Choo Choo! “All aboard!” “Bye-bye!”
I’m on a train!

The more we play together,

Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer, do
I’m half crazy all for the love of you!
It won’t be a stylish marriage
I can’t afford a carriage
But you’ll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two

Lyrics:
Let’s go for a nature walk
Listen to the birdies talk
Go strolling in the grass
While clouds go rolling past

**Whistles catchy tune**

Short and leafy forest trees  
Tall and pointy forest trees 
Forest trees stand happily 
As we’re whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

Red and orange autumn leaves
Green and yellow autumn leaves
Autumn leaves dance in the breeze
As we’re whistling
 
**Whistles catchy tune**

Sweet and tiny flowers bloom
Big and happy flowers bloom
Can you smell their sweet perfume

As we’re whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

Flapping, chirping birds go by
Swimming, quacking ducks go by
Floating free and flying high
As we’re whistling

**Whistles catchy tune**

We went for a nature walk
Listened to the birdies talk
Went strolling in the grass
While clouds went rolling past

**Whistles catchy tune**

Lyrics:

It’s time to read now
I want to read a book
Let’s all imagine!
It’s time to take a look!
Yes it’s my favorite time of day
Dad reads to me, Hip-hip-hooray!

I’m on a planet
I found some aliens
I’m on a spaceship
With all my new blue friends

It’s time to read now
I want to read a book
Let’s all imagine!
It’s time to take a look!
Yes it’s my favorite time of day
TomTom reads to me, Hip-hip-hooray!

I’m on a white horse
Holding my sword and shield
To fight the dragon
Down on the battlefield

It’s time to read now
I want to read a book
Let’s all imagine!
It’s time to take a look!
Yes it’s my favorite time of day
Mom reads to me, Hip-hip-hooray!

You’re on some pink clouds
They’re cotton candy 
I’m on some pink clouds
With fuzzy bunnies

Lyrics:
There was a Country Mouse who loved the country
There was a City Mouse who loved the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse liked to eat oats and beans
The City Mouse liked to eat cake and cheese
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse listened to the bugs and birds
The City Mouse listened to the cars and trucks
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse looked at the moon and stars
The City Mouse looked at the signs and lights
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse lived near the fields and trees
The City Mouse lived near the shops and streets
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse invited the City Mouse
The City Mouse visited the Country Mouse
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse showed his friend the country 
The City Mouse talked about the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The Country Mouse said, “Please feel at home”
The City Mouse wanted to go back home
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse invited the Country Mouse
The Country Mouse visited the City Mouse
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse showed his friend the city
The Country Mouse was chased by a kitty
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

The City Mouse said, “Please feel at home”
The Country Mouse wanted to go back home
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

There was a Country Mouse who loved the country
There was a City Mouse who loved the city
There was a Country Mouse and a City Mouse
And they were very good friends

Lyrics:
Garage Sale! Garage Sale!
You can buy a treasure
You can buy a toy
What’s old to me, is new to you
Like this ball or these two shoes!

I have played with you
I have played with you
I’ll remember you just because
It was so fun to buzz buzz buzz!

When it’s time to share your things
Think about the joy it brings
Let it go and you will see
How happy someone else could be!      
 
I will play with you
I will play with you
I’ll keep you and I will hum
It was so fun to strum strum strum!

Garage Sale! Garage Sale! 
You can buy a treasure
You can buy a toy
What’s old to me, is new to you
Garage Sale! Share the joy!

I will play with you
I will play with you
I’ll keep you just because
It was so fun to buzz buzz buzz!

Buzz buzz buzz

When it’s time to share your things
Think about the joy it brings
Let it go and you will see
How happy someone else could be!  

Garage Sale! Garage Sale!
You can buy a treasure
You can buy a toy
What’s old to me
Cody’s Mom: is new to me!

I will play with you

It is so fun to strum strum strum!

Garage Sale! Garage Sale!

Lyrics:
Jolly old Saint Nicholas
Lean your ear this way;
Don't you tell a single soul
What I'm going to say,
Christmas Eve is coming soon;
Now you dear old man,
Whisper what you'll bring to me;
Tell me if you can.

Ho Ho Ho!

When the clock is striking twelve,
When I'm fast asleep,
Down the chimney broad and black
With your pack you'll creep;
All the stockings you will find
Hanging in a row;
Mine will be the shortest one;
You'll be sure to know.

Ho Ho Ho!

Mom and dad want grown up things
YoYo wants a dolly
TomTom wants a story book,
Christmas sure is jolly
As for me, it’s getting late
This ole Christmas night
Choose for me, dear Santa Claus,
What you think is right.

Jolly old Saint Nicholas
Lean your ear this way;
Don't you tell a single soul
What I'm going to say,
Christmas Day is here at last
And it’s time to see
What you brought to me last night
Underneath our tree

Ho Ho Ho!
